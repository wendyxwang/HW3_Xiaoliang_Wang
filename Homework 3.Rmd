#Homework 3 Questions:
Reproduce the results presented in Figure 2 of the following paper: Qian, F., Bolen, C. R., Jing, C., Wang, X., Zheng, W., Zhao, H., et al. (2013). Impaired toll-like receptor 3-mediated immune responses from macrophages of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Clinical and Vaccine Immunology : CVI, 20(2), 146â€“155. doi:10.1128/CVI.00530-12

You will have to:

Get the data from GEO
Normalize the data (if necessary)
Use limma to test for differential expression
Display the results using a heatmap [Hint: Use the pheatmap package]

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
